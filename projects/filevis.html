<h3>FileVis</h3>

<p>FileVis is a disk space usage analyzer I wrote to replicate and expand upon an open source utility not available on Mac OS X or Windows. It is a cross platform compatible Java program which allows full traversal of a directory after a loading time. Its binary form is available <a href="/files/filevis.jar">here</a>, and its source code is available <a href="/files/filevis.zip">here</a>. To run, a command prompt or terminal will have to be used as the program sometimes will trigger an out of memory error due to the Java virtual machine's predilection towards evil. The command that works on most systems is "java -jar &lt;path to filevis.jar&gt; &lt;path you want to analyze&gt; -Xms1G -Xmx2G". For example, on my computer that would be "java -jar Desktop/filevis.jar /Users/ -Xms1G -Xmx2G". Left click on a directory's slice to enter it, and right click to go back.</p>
