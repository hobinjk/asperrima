<h3>Block</h3>

<p>Block was the first game bot I ever programmed. It was written in python and uses a simple anagram solving algorithm to brute force the Letterblox game. The bot can also be put into a mode where it mimics human keypresses, with random delays and mistakes to pass a Letterblox Turing test. It's the basis of the Python tutorial on the sidebar. You can find more information, including partial source code, about it there.</p>
<p>The following is a short video demonstrating this program I made back when I was a Sophomore--it's a bit overly dramatic.</p>
