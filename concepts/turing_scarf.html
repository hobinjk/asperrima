<h2>Turing Scarf</h2>
<p>Combining programming and knitting, the Turing scarf is a simple but fun knitting project for the knitter starting with intarsia. My original idea for this came about when I wanted to encode a message on a scarf for a friend of mine. At the time, I was learning the ins and outs of the Turing pit language Brainfsck, which consists of only eight different commands. I decided to write a program that printed out a short message, and wrote up the intarsia patterns for the basic Brainfsck characters.</p>

<h3>How To</h3>
<p>If you want your own Turing scarf, make sure you have the time and patience to not only do one of the most challenging knitting techiques, but also program in one of the most ridiculous programming languages.</p>
<p>The first step is to create your program. Many tutorials and web-based interpreters exist for the language.</p>
<p>You'll need a ton of yarn and a ton of bobbins or similar anti-tangling device, but once you have these just use the pattern editor provided below and cast on N*11+4 stitches, where N is the amount of characters per line you want</p>
<p>Finally, wear and flaunt your nerdy scarf wherever programmers are to be found.</p>
<p>Try experimenting with the pattern editor below:</p>
