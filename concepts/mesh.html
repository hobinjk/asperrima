<p>No-one has ever looked at javascript and thought that it could be used for interactive mesh generation for 3D printing, until now. I have created <a href="/concepts/fileupload/upload_test.html">this project</a> which allows a user to upload an image (most likely of a logo) and after tweaking a few settings download a file which is ready for 3D printing using ReplicatorG. This program relies on the data URI and may or may not slow your computer down considerably while running. Upon clicking the "Download STL" button there will be a large amount of lag as your computer creates an entire file using Javascript, which happens to be the last thing ECMA intended for their language to do. If you want to see results within a year or two, use a small image file ( around 150x150 maximum ).</p>
