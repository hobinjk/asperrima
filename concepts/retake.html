<h3>Retake</h3>
<p>Retake is a project currently under development by me that once completed will revolutionize the student's method of taking notes. Current use of a computer suffers from two problems: the internet is distracting, and some teachers don't allow computers. These issues force students to go back to the Medieval practice of writing down thoughts slowly and messily using a pen or pencil.</p>
<p>The Retake system circumvents both issues with computers by creating an easily portable and not distracting device capable of instantly printing out what the student types, causing easy backwards compatibility with standard writing. A video demonstrating the proof of concept is embedded below.</p>
