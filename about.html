<p>I am a high school student with significant qualifications in software development, web design, and rapid prototyping. Through my experience with the SMALLab program I have become skilled in the design and development of interactive educational scenarios for use in K-12 learning. I also like knitting and making things that do cool stuff. I've programmed in too many languages to remember, but my favorites are Java, C, C++, Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS.</p>
<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p>My current programming projects are the StrokeOrder and CharPr scenarios for SMALLab and a computer vision based control method for Blue Tide Robotics, in addition to several other minor projects. Information about these can likely be found at other places around this site.</p>
