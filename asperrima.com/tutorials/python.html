<h2>So you want to learn Python?</h2>
<h3>A result oriented approach.</h3>
<br/>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">Note: This tutorial assumes you know a language like Java, C, or C++, and want to pick up the extremely easy python, but don't know how to use it to streamline your programming. If you don't know a language, check out <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a> for a more suitable tutorial.</p>
<h3>Why Python?</h3>
<p>One word: lists. While C and Java have ridiculous amounts of speed and power, what they lack are the list functions of python. For this project, lists are used throughout but performance isn't a consideration, making it a perfect candidate for python.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Starters</h3>
<p>The problem we're going to work on is creating a program that will automatically type in all of the words that can be made from a set of letters, a la Scrabble. Incidentally, this happens to be a way to win in the online game Letterblox.</p>
<p>The code starts off with simple instantiation, showing off python's lack of typing and easy array/dictionary creation.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
numletters = 6 #yay no type
allwords = [] #yay array
dictionary = {} #yay dictionary/hashmap (not used for this example, but still cool)
</pre>
<br/>
<h3>Moving on</h3>
<p>Next we want a source for our words. In any other language this would be at 4-10 lines. In python it is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
dictfile = open('wordlist.txt', 'r')
for word in dictfile:
</pre>
<p>This is the power of list based programming.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Logic!</h3>
<p>Now that we have a word, we need to see if we can make it. For this, we create a new list that is a copy of our letters, and remove from it until we either can't find a letter or have successfully found every letter for our word. In python, this looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
#word already set
cur_lets = list(letters) #make a list!
found = True  #boolean
for letter in word: #yes, this actually works
    if letter not in cur_lets: #not found (magic)
        found = False
        break
    idx = cur_lets.index(letter)
    del cur_lets[idx] #remove the letter for now
if found:
    allwords.append(word) #keeping track of it
</pre>
<p>And there you have it! You can find the finished program <a href="/files/block.zip">here.</a></p>
<p>The following is a short video demonstrating this program I made back when I was a Sophomore--it's a bit overly dramatic.</p>
