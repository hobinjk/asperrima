<p>The following program is a sketch I created in processing that draws a black and white image using only text characters ("ASCII art"). Unlike other programs like it, it doesn't just consider the image as a series of black and white spaces that will be replaced by a "light" character and a "dark" character. Instead, it attempts to find the character that best models the overlapped area on a pixel by pixel basis, creating an image that is much closer to the image that a human artist would create.</p>
