<h3>Sir Tet</h3>
<p>Sir Tet ( Tetris spelled backwards ) is a Tetris bot I developed in my free time. Currently its skill level is about that of a human with a beginner's knowledge of the game. It uses computer vision as well as the Java Robot classes to carry out actions proposed by a custom decision engine and not fail horribly most of the time.
