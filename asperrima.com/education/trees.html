<h3>Trees</h3>
<p>"Trees" is an interactive web application for my English class which traces the lineage of several languages. You can check it out <a href="/education/trees/trees.html">here</a>, but keep in mind that your browser window should be as wide as possible when loading the page. It was an experiment in the use of DHTML and generally fancy web technologies in an educational setting. In this case, it is much more fluid and immersive than a slow-loading wikipedia article, although it conveys less information.</p>
